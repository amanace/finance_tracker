Brief Summary of Project:

The personal financial tracker is a web-based application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Its primary purpose is to assist individuals in maintaining records of their income and expenses. By using this application, users can track their financial transactions and obtain a clear overview of their total balance.

The project combines elements of finance and technology to provide a user-friendly interface where individuals can input their income and expense details. The application calculates the current balance based on the transactions entered. It aims to raise awareness among users regarding their financial status and encourage them to make informed decisions about their spending and saving habits.
